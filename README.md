# Go URL Shortener

My take on the Gophercise [URL Shortener exercise](https://github.com/gophercises/urlshort).

Read paths and urls from either yaml or json files.

In the future this could take in args with files, but that's not how servers work. It is more likely this would read from a DB and include a form for generating shortened URLs.

Server runs on `localhost:8080`

Available stored paths in `urls.json` and `urls.yaml`
